    <p> Complexity means "reduction and removal of redundancy", as first defined by John Locke (1632-1704): "Ideas thus made up of several simple ones put together, I call complex; such as beauty, gratitude, a man, an army, the
        universe". This is illustrated in art by Picasso in his famous bull drawing from 1945, shown above.

    </a>
    <p> Crystalline swelling (intercalation) occurs when external molecules, such as H2O enter the interlayer space within a clay particle. High temperatures facilitate the intercalation and the distance between clay layers increase
        during osmotic swelling. Sketch taken from: <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00618" target="new">Hansen, E. L. et al., Scientific Reports by Nature 2, 618 (2012).</a></p>
